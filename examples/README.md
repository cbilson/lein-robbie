# Examples

Here are example apps you can use as reference to see how things are
done with robbie.

* cordova_app: This is a port (with artistic license) of the cordova
  example app to clojure script. Instead of just porting it though, I
  tried to replicate the features in idiomatic clojure.
  
  You can use this example to see how to call the cordova API from clojurescript.

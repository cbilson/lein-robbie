lein-robbie is a [leiningen][1] plugin for
creating Android apps built using phonegap and clojurescript.

## Pre-requisites

* [Leiningen 2.0][1]
* Install the android SDK:
  * On macosx with brew, try `brew install android-sdk`
  * Go to
    [The Android SDK installation instructions][2]
    for instruction on other platforms.

NOTE: You _don't_ need to have installed or downloaded Apache phonegap
to use lein-robbie, but you might want to [grab it][3] to look at examples
or documentation.

## Installation

To your `~/.lein/profiles.clj`, add a plugin entry for lein-robbie. Mine
looks like this:

```clojure
{:user {:plugins [[lein-swank "1.4.4"]
                  [lein-pprint "1.1.1"]
                  [lein-robbie "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
                  [clj-stacktrace "0.2.4"]]}}
```

The next time you use leiningen, the lein-robbie plugin will be
downloaded and ready to go.

## Usage

Once you've got all the prerequisites installed, here's the basic workflow:

    $ lein new robbie my-app
    Copying ...
    Generating ...
    
    $ lein cljsbuild once
    ...
    
    # create your AVD if neccesary
    $ android create avd -n robbie_image -t android-13
    ...
    
    # start the AVD
    $ emulator -avd robbie_image &
    ...
    
    $ ant debug install
    ...
    
    # verify you can see 'my_app' in the apps screen in the emulator
    
    # launch your app
    
    # hack, hack, hack
    
    $ lein cljsbuild once && ant debug install
    
    # goto 'launch your app'
    
It's also possible to specify which version of Android you wish to
target:

    $ lein new robbie myapp target android-10
    
You can always change this later in the generated AndroidManifest.xml
file in your project.

You can also tell robbie you'd like to include a javascript framework
with the project. Currently only [jQuery Mobile 1.0][4] and
[jQuery Mobile 1.1 RC1][5] are supported:

    $ lein new robbie myapp target android-10 framework jquery-mobile-1.0

or

    $ lein new robbie myapp target android-10 framework jquery-mobile-1.1

## TODO

* I'd like to override `lein install` to compile cljs and do `ant
  debug install`. My understanding is that I can just make a new
  `leiningen/install` function and it will override the default one as
  long
  [as it's newer than the leiningen built-in install task][6].
* Maybe it would be better to use a hook? (as in, robert)
* Add some subtasks for other android stuff, like release compiles,
  catting/tailing the adb log, so I don't have to remember how to use
  the android tools to do this and so the cljsbuild happens whenever
  it needs to, instead of having a separate step.
* Add example apps
* Longer term: make an iOS and possibly other platform version if
  this.
